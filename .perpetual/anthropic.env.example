# Example .env config, version: development

# Options for Anthropic provider. Below are sane defaults for Anthropic provider (as of Jan 2025)
# Anthropic provider has no embedding models support (as for Apr 2025)

# Configuration files should have ".env" extensions and it can be placed to the following locations:
# Project local config: <Project root>/.perpetual/*.env
# Global config. On Linux: ~/.config/Perpetual/*.env ; On Windows: <User profile dir>\AppData\Roaming\Perpetual\*.env
# Also, the parameters can be exported to the system environment before running the utility, then they will have priority over the parameters in the configuration files. The "*.env" files will be loaded in alphabetical order, with parameters in previously loaded files taking precedence.

# Uncomment if this is the only .env config file you are using
