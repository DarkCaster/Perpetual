# Anthropic provider has no embedding models support (as for Apr 2025)

# Configuration files should have ".env" extensions and it can be placed to the following locations:
# Project local config: <Project root>/.perpetual/*.env
# Global config. On Linux: ~/.config/Perpetual/*.env ; On Windows: <User profile dir>\AppData\Roaming\Perpetual\*.env
# Also, the parameters can be exported to the system environment before running the utility, then they will have priority over the parameters in the configuration files. The "*.env" files will be loaded in alphabetical order, with parameters in previously loaded files taking precedence.

# When dealing with files that cannot be read as proper UTF[8/16/32] encoded file, try using this fallback encoding as last resort.
# You can use encoding names supported by "golang.org/x/text/encoding/ianaindex" package
