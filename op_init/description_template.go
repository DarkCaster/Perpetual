const descriptionTemplate = `# Project Description

This is a project description template. The project description provides optional extra context about your project to the LLM for "implement", "explain", and "doc" operations, and it can also be included in the code report generated with the "report" operation. This document, if present, is fed to the LLM at the beginning of each request.

**File Location:**
For Perpetual to use the project description, save it in the ".perpetual/description.md" file in your project's root directory, or specify the path using the "-d" flag (e.g., Perpetual implement -d ./custom_path/description.md).

## Format Requirements

- Markdown or Plain Text only.
- Size: up to 500 words, less is better.
- Avoid complex markdown elements (tables, diagrams).

## Recommended Structure

1. **Project Purpose** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Key Technologies** (languages, frameworks, databases, infrastructure)
3. **Architectural Features** (microservices, design patterns)
4. **Coding Standards** (code style, testing frameworks, mandatory patterns)
5. **Project Structure** (where to find particular features, where to place interfaces, classes, models, etc)

**NOTES:**

- You should never include secrets, API keys, or personal data, because it will be exposed to the LLM.
- The project description document is optional. Its main purposes are to help the LLM better understand your project, navigate its structure, and produce more integrated code. This document should improve model performance for larger projects (or smaller local models).
- Although you can generate this document by using "doc" operation, manually writing it is preferable to prevent LLMs from omitting critical details and to break the cycle of feeding AI-generated content back into the model, improving performance.
