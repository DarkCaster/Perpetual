# Note: this config should only be used with original OpenAI provider.
# It use some API fixes depending on model name and other parameters.
# If you want to use any other OpenAI API compatible provider (including Azure OpenAI), please use "generic" provider instead (see generic.env.example for details)

# Configuration files should have ".env" extensions and it can be placed to the following locations:
# Project local config: <Project root>/.perpetual/*.env
# Global config. On Linux: ~/.config/Perpetual/*.env ; On Windows: <User profile dir>\AppData\Roaming\Perpetual\*.env
# Also, the parameters can be exported to the system environment before running the utility, then they will have priority over the parameters in the configuration files. The "*.env" files will be loaded in alphabetical order, with parameters in previously loaded files taking precedence.

# Uncomment if this is the only .env config file you are using
